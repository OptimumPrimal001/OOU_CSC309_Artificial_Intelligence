        "*   All three algorithms (BFS, DFS, UCS) found a path of the same length: 12.\n",
        "*   Depth-First Search (DFS) was the most efficient in terms of expanded states, expanding only 12 states.\n",
        "*   Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Uniform-Cost Search (UCS) expanded the same number of states, 15 each.\n",

        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Found a path of length 12 and expanded 15 states.\n",
        "*   **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Found a path of length 12 and expanded 12 states.\n",
        "*   **Uniform-Cost Search (UCS):** Found a path of length 12 and expanded 15 states.\n",
        "*   All three search algorithms successfully identified a path to the goal state with an identical path length of 12.\n",
        "*   DFS was the most efficient algorithm in terms of the number of states expanded, requiring only 12 expansions, which is 20% fewer than BFS and UCS.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   For problems where finding *any* optimal path is sufficient and memory is a concern, DFS can be a highly efficient choice if the goal is not too deep, as demonstrated by its minimal state expansion.\n",
        "*   Further analysis could involve problems with varying state-space complexities or non-uniform edge costs to observe how the performance differences between these algorithms change.\n"
